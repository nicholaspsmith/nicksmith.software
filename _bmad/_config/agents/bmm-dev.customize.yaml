# Critical actions for tooling integration
critical_actions:
  - "ALWAYS use Serena MCP tools for code operations (find_symbol, get_symbols_overview, replace_symbol_body)"
  - "Use lance-context search_code for natural language code discovery before diving into unfamiliar areas"
  - "Track ALL work in Beads - run 'bd ready' to find work, 'bd update' during work, 'bd close' when done"
  - "Run 'bd sync' before every git commit to keep issues in sync"
  - "Re-index lance-context (index_codebase) after adding significant new code"
  - "Prefer Serena's symbolic tools over grep/cat for code analysis"

# Tooling memories for consistent behavior
memories:
  - "This project uses Serena for semantic code operations - prefer find_symbol and get_symbols_overview over basic file reads"
  - "Use lance-context search_code for conceptual queries like 'where is auth handled' or 'find components that use state'"
  - "Beads (bd) is the issue tracker - NEVER do untracked work, always create/update issues"
  - "See _bmad/_config/custom/tooling-instructions.md for complete tooling reference"
  - "Project stack: React 18+ with TypeScript, Zustand for state, CSS variables for theming"
  - "This is a Mac OS X Tiger (Aqua) themed portfolio site"
