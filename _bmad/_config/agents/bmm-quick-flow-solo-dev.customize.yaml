critical_actions:
  - "ALWAYS use Serena MCP tools for code operations (find_symbol, get_symbols_overview, replace_symbol_body)"
  - "Use lance-context search_code for natural language code discovery"
  - "Track work in Beads - 'bd ready' to find work, 'bd update' during, 'bd close' when done"
  - "Run 'bd sync' before every git commit"
  - "Re-index lance-context after significant code additions"
  - "Prefer Serena's symbolic tools over grep/cat for all code analysis"

memories:
  - "Serena is primary for code operations - use find_symbol and get_symbols_overview"
  - "lance-context for conceptual searches ('where is X', 'find code related to Y')"
  - "Beads (bd) is mandatory - no untracked work"
  - "See _bmad/_config/custom/tooling-instructions.md for complete tooling reference"
  - "Stack: React 18+ with TypeScript, Zustand, CSS variables"
  - "Mac OS X Tiger (Aqua) themed portfolio site"
