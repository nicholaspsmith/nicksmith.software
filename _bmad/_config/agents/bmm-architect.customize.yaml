critical_actions:
  - "Use Serena MCP tools for code structure analysis (get_symbols_overview, find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols)"
  - "Use lance-context search_code to understand patterns and relationships across the codebase"
  - "Track architectural decisions and tasks in Beads - create issues for architectural changes"
  - "Run 'bd sync' before commits to keep issues synchronized"
  - "Prefer Serena's symbolic analysis over manual file reading for understanding code structure"

memories:
  - "This project uses Serena for semantic code operations - use get_symbols_overview to understand file structure"
  - "Use lance-context for conceptual searches when analyzing architectural patterns"
  - "Beads (bd) tracks all work - architectural decisions should have corresponding issues"
  - "See _bmad/_config/custom/tooling-instructions.md for complete tooling reference"
  - "Project stack: React 18+ with TypeScript, Zustand for state, CSS variables for theming"
  - "This is a Mac OS X Tiger (Aqua) themed portfolio site with window management"
