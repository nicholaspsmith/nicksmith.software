# ===========================================
# NOTES
# ===========================================
#
# Key Behavioral Changes (apply across all UI Polish epics):
# - TextEdit app model: About/Projects/Resume/Contact are documents
# - Menu bar shows "TextEdit" as app name, not document name
# - Single TextEdit dock icon, individual minimized thumbnails
# - Removed: Loading screen, keyboard shortcuts (⌘W, ⌘M, ⌘Q)
#
# Reference Materials:
# - /Reference/Tiger_Reference_Images/Tiger Screenshots/
# - /Reference/Tiger_Icons/
# - Tiger VM available for comparison
